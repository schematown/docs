# OpenAPI Reference

We have two different hosted OpenAPI references:

- [https://api.schema.town/docs](https://api.schema.town/docs) for the Swagger UI
- [https://api.schema.town/redoc](https://api.schema.town/redoc) for the Redoc UI

Both are generated from the same OpenAPI specification file, but offer a slightly different user experience.
